# Hotel-Website

This is a project used with educational purposes. A Hotel website with technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, BOOTSTRAP and SQL was generared.
Users can log in, sign up, make reservations, etc.
Admin can edit user details, deactivate accounts, change status from reservations, etc.

The objective was the project was to use the tecnologies learned in "Webtechnologien" and develop a responsive web design with a meaningfull example.
Unfortunately this project, even though it was designed to be done in groups of two, had to be delevoped entirely by me, as my partner had to leave the University due to private reasons. That is the main reason for the lack of structure in the files, as the coding of features needed to be prioritized .
